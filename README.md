<p> Our game starts off as a hero. His name is Scott Pilgrim, and the objective of the game is to avoid the copcars that are racing at you. The copcars are not all the same speed, so it makes it a challenge to time the movement of your character so that you do not collide with the cops. The character is also assigned the job of collecting stacks of money that pass by on the road. If you get hit by a car, the game is over. If you collect a certain amount of money, you win the game.<p>
