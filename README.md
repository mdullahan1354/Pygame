<p style="color:green;">Our game starts off as a hero. His name is Scott Pilgrim, and the objective of the game is to avoid the copcars that are racing at you. You may be faster than the copcars so it makes it possible for a possible getaway. The copcars are not all the same speed, so it makes it a challenge to time the movement of your character so that you do not collide with the cops. The character is also assigned the job of collecting stacks of money that pass by on the road. The combination of collecting cash while avoiding cars makes the game fun but somewhat challenging. If you collect a certain amount money, YOU WIN THE GAME! But if you accidentally get hit by one of the cars zooming by, YOU LOSE!</p>
